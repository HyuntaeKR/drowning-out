# Antisolvent Screening for Drowning-Out Crystallization Based on COSMO calculation

## About

* This repository includes python scripts used for the screening of antisolvent when designing a drowing-out crystallization system.
* The methodology for the screening process is developed by **Molecular Design Lab** of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering of Korea University.
    * Literature for the methodology has not been published yet.
* The methodology uses activity coefficient calculated with COSMO-SAC. The user-defined module <code>cosmosac2</code> was used, which is a modified and upgraded version of
the COSMO-SAC calculation module developed by **Beom Chan Ryu** of **Molecular Design Lab**.
  * Check the literature for further information about the module: [Link]
### About the codes
* <code>ternary_calculate</code> is an user-defined module for calculating the composition of ternary solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) of a solute-solvent-antisolvent system.
